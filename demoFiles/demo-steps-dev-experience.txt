Use the Liberty Getting Started Labd and Demo PoT Techzone environment
		novnc password: IBMDem0s


WhereAmI app that we implement https in server.xml and color changes based on http or https scheme used.  
And make Header in Servlet output in UpperCase. The WhereAmI.java has the example code in there commented o



1. git clone the repo that contains the lab and demo artifacts

2. make directory /home/techzone/Student/dev
3. change to directory /home/techzone/Student/dev


4. Start with the OpenLiberty starter: https://openliberty.io/start/
Use Lars lab guide to get started and create the Student/dev directory where we will create the Maven project. 

Create a Maven project, then add the WhereAmI code and server.xml by unzipping the "whereami-with-tests.zip" into 
Use Java 17, Jakarta 10, and name “whereami” in the Starter.io

	
5. unzip "whereami-with-tests.zip" into the /home/techzone/Student/dev
6. change to directory /home/techzone/Student/dev/whereami
7. Launch vscode   using "code ." command from the "whereami" directory
8. Run thrugh demo 1 time before doing live with client. 
9. Cleanup the updates in the app and server.xml
10. stop Liberty server from vs code

1. start Libety in VS Code
2. Browser: show whereami app runinng on port 9080  https://localhost:9080/whereami
3. Edit server.xml 
	add HTTPS port 9443 
	add feature "transportSecurity-1.0
	View the ssl config at the bottom of the server.xml file (points to the security token already created prior to demo)
	
4. 	Browser: show whereami running on HTTPS port 9443 https://localhost:9443/whereami
5. Edit whereami.java
	Add code to check for coloer in the 'zone' variable
6. Browser: Test HTTP and HTTPS URLs to whereami	
		HTTPS is in GREEN 
		HTTP is in RED
		
7. Run the integration tests, which look for the header in the whereami app in UpperCase	
			Fails since the header in not in uppoercase
			See messages in test output
8. Add code in whereami to make the Header in UpperCase
9. Browser: see whereami header in uppoer case    http://localhost:9080/whereami
10. Rerun the integration tests
